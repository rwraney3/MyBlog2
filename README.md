# MyBlog
Udacity - Front End Web Developer - Project One

# The Project
In this project we were to use our knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a personal blog.  
The blog was to have at least two pages of HTML (a Blog Homepage and a Blog Post) using seperate CSS files.

The project was also to include pictures, general links, and links to social media.

The pages are to be responsive, making use of @media in CSS.

#Status
As of now, the pages appear the way I have intended.  The backgrounds match, as do the fonts. All pages are responsive.
I am not sure I have included all that is required, as I am not a blogger.  After looking at a few, I think I'm on the right
track.  Looking forward to a response from Udacity to identify areas of need.
